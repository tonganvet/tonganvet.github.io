Livestock plays an important role in the social, cultural and economic environment of Tongan communities. Indeed many, of the important social and cultural events in island life cannot be properly carried out without the slaughter and presentation of livestock in sufficient numbers.

Livestock Division works in partnership with livestock farmers to develop prosperous, efficient and sustainable animal health and production systems, producing healthy animals and safe products for food security and income generation.

Improving livestock sector will mean less reliance on imports, higher rural incomes, meeting our food security needs, and assistance with meeting national development goals.

These are the major activities and projects currently undergoing at Livestock Division, located at Tokomololo.
